Fellow residents [Julia Kiryanova](https://tenjinyamastudio.jp/event/juliakiryanova_ex2025) and [Pin Yi Tu](https://tenjinyamastudio.jp/event/pin-yi-tu-exh-nov-2025) are currently showing their work at the Tenjinyama Studio.

Also, this Saturday (Nov 15h) from 13:00 onwards there will be a _Opening Party_ and Artist's Talk. And maybe some Mushroom Music!

- Found a book/booklet by a previous Artist-in-Residence titled 'This book is written by GPT-2' (2018). Use ChatGPT-3, -4, -5 to retranslated/expand/answer it.

- Chatted with Pin about _Sunday Morning_ Japanese TV. We both admired the Cardboard/DIY aesthetic of info-graphics on Japanese TV, especially on NHK. This - and Pythagora Switch (ピタゴラスイッチ) explains a lot.
