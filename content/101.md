I will be an _Artist-in-Residence_ at the [Tenjinyama Art Studio](https://tenjinyamastudio.jp) in Sapporo from November 5th until December 24th.

The Tenjinyama Art Studio is a programme run by Sapporo City, housed in a former hotel on the top of Mount Tenjin. The space acts as a library, community center, exhibtion space - and residency place for both foreign and domestic artists. Once a month the _Art & Breakfast_ and the _Open Studio_ events.

I aim to be at the studio
research Residency
production residency

collaboration residency.

Instead on working on one project/piece during the residency, I want to explore different elements and directions genres, I don't want to

I will also ~~force myself~~ happily write an update each day during the _51 days of Tenjinyama_.

Some directions I want to explore:
- Zombie Glitches: Re-animating dead media (LaserDisc, VHD)
- PCT-15 Test Patterns: Image ⇆ Sound
- DNA Extraction & PCR for ¬🧬🍅 Project
- Non-conventional Computing: Quadra 700, NextStation Color, SGI Indy
- GameBoy Camera
- _Remixing_ Audio Test Records
- Ludic Labware↗︎
- δ (Delta) Gardens: Gammator-NT
