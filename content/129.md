The Sony CP-33 Repeat Card Player "The Repeater"
The American Way (Intermediate)

Interesting to note, that another contribution to the same topic come from this blog
https://41j.com/blog/2015/11/the-repeater-cp-33-repeat-card-player/, which is run by Nava Whiteford - one of the authorities in Sequencing Tech & Bio - and who is also Japan-based, and therefore might frequent HardOFFs quite frequently as well.

### Card Boxes

- The American Way (Intermediate)
- Business English

The cards themselves have the japanese sentence printed on the back. The english translation is only audible by scanning the card.

Player works with the same 6V power supply as the PCT-15, but the feeding mechanisms seems to be broken, need to investigate more. Some sounds are coming out.
